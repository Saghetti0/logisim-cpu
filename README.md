# logisim-cpu

Really crappy 8-bit CPU that I made in logisim because I was bored

The circuit of the main CPU is in `cpu.circ`. You need to install logisim to open it.<br>
The rest of the files here are various files I used to create and debug the CPU. This is just a file dump, and almost nothing here has been cleaned up or properly documented. The most useful file here is probably `architecture_info`, with a full list of instructions and info.

I might come back to this later and write proper documentation, but don't count on it.
